Vinegar is an aqueous solution of acetic acid and trace compounds that may include flavorings. Vinegar typically contains 5â€“8% acetic acid by volume. Usually, the acetic acid is produced by a double fermentation; converting simple sugars to ethanol using yeast and ethanol to acetic acid by acetic acid bacteria.
