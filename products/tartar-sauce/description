Tartar sauce is a condiment made of mayonnaise, chopped pickles, capers and herbs such as tarragon and dill. Tartar sauce can also be enhanced with the addition of other varieties of herbs, lemon juice, or olives. It is most often served as a condiment with seafood dishes such as fried fish and fried oysters.
