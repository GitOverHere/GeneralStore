Mustard seeds are the small round seeds of various mustard plants. The seeds are usually about 1 to 2 millimetres in diameter and may be colored from yellowish white to black. They are an important spice in many regional foods and may come from one of three different plants: black mustard, brown Indian mustard, or white/yellow mustard. Grinding and mixing the seeds with water, vinegar or other liquids creates the yellow condiment known as prepared mustard.
